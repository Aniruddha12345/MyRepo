* Java Editions-
1. Java SE(java standard edition) - It includes Java programming APIs such as java.lang, java.io, java.net, java.util, java.sql, java.math etc. It includes core topics like OOPs, String, Regex, Exception, Inner classes, Multithreading, I/O Stream, Networking, AWT, Swing, Reflection, Collection, etc.
2. Java EE(java enterprise edition) - mainly used to develop web and enterprise applications. It is built on the top of the Java SE platform. It includes topics like Servlet, JSP, Web Services, EJB, JPA, etc.
3. Java ME(java micro edition) - mainly used to develop mobile applications.
4. Java FX - It is used to develop rich internet applications. It uses a light-weight user interface API.

* In cpp, operator overloading is there & java doesn't suppport operator overloading.
  In cpp, const and goto keywords are there but in java they are there but unused instead of that final & continue is there.
  cpp support both call by value & call by reference but java only support call by value.
  
* jvm - virtual machine which takkes bite code and run on system. it is oplatform dependant
  jre - runtime environment consists of jvm + jars to run the application
  jdk - developement environment - jre + tools for developing the application(javac, java)

* Association, aggregation and composition.

* object based vs object oriented programming language - objects based does't support inheritance(ex javascript , vbscript).

* JIT compiler - 
   
   sourceCode.java--------> Compiler ----------> ByteCode -------
                                                                 |
                                                                 |
                   Native Machine Code<-------JIT Compiler <-----|
 JIT compiler in jvm compile bytecode into native machie code at run time.

* A java constructor can have access modifier while declaring(private, protected, public, default constructor)for control of object creation but can not be abstract, final, synchronized, static.
